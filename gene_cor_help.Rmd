### PAIRWISE GENE CORRELATION

```{r include = FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The pairwise gene correlation module requires only the input of the TPM file. 

Two genes can be selected from the drop down lists (based on the first column of the TPM file). Additionally, different correlation methods (pearson, kendall and spearman) can be selected. 

A plot with log converted TPM values between the two specified genes will be output. The plot will also contain a linear model fitted line. Above the plot will be the relevant correlation coefficient (r) and associated p-value (p). 

Downloaded images will have the correlation coefficient and associated p-value printed in the top left of the plot.
