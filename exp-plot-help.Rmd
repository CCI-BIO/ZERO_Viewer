### Expression plot

The expression plot module allows the user to generate a TPM plot for all samples for a single gene. The user will additionally be able to highlight a specific sample within the plot as well as the associated samples within the same group. 

The module requires the user to upload 2 files:

* **1. TPM count table.**

* **2. Sample metadata file.**

```{r out.width = "50%", echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("Instruction_images/expre_1.png")
```

The expression plot module allows the user to select the patient and gene of interest using a drop down menu. 

The selected patient is highlighted as a red triangle while the green dots highlight patients that are part of the same group. (refer to below image (1))

*The interactive plot has the addditional property of hovering over data points to display sample specific meta information.* 

```{r out.width = "50%", echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("Instruction_images/Expr_2.png")
```

The generated expression plot can be **saved as a png file** using the download button.(refer to the above image (2))
